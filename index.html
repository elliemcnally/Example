      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hazy Days, created by Mike Ren, is an unforgettable game that immerses players in the harsh realities of living in a smog-filled world. Through Xiao Feng, a young girl navigating her daily life in a polluted city, players experience the silent yet pervasive challenges of breathing in such an environment. It is a hauntingly beautiful reflection of the realities faced by millions worldwide.</p>
      <p>In Hazy Days, players control Xiao Feng by managing her breathing, an activity affected by the constant presence of pollution. As the game progresses, text and visuals display information about air quality and its impact. Scenes include navigating crowded streets, spending time at home, and attending school, each illustrating the difficulty of daily life. Based on the player’s performance, Xiao Feng may either continue her day or become too sick to proceed. The end-of-day choices highlight the stark consequences of poor air quality and player decisions, creating an emotionally charged gameplay experience.</p>

      <h2>Relations to Outside Readings</h2>
      <p><strong>German Expressionism:</strong> The visuals of Hazy Days echo the artistic movement of German Expressionism, where exaggerated forms and stark contrasts convey profound emotional truths. The game’s muted tones and haunting landscapes reflect the oppressive environment, much like the unsettling atmospheres in films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Kracauer 1947). Both use their aesthetics to externalize inner turmoil, making the unseen, whether it’s pollution or psychological despair, tangible and deeply impactful.</p>
      <p><strong>Persistence in Puzzle-Solving:</strong> Lindley’s observation on how emotions impact persistence in solving puzzles finds resonance in Hazy Days. The game’s difficulty often leads to failure, with Xiao Feng becoming sick if players falter (Lindley 2020). This emotional consequence drives persistence, as players feel a personal responsibility for her well-being. The stakes are not just mechanical success but the poignant reality of her health, amplifying the game’s immersive and educational impact.</p>
      <p><strong>The Pleasure Principle:</strong> Freud’s Pleasure Principle, which emphasizes the human drive to avoid pain and seek immediate gratification, is subverted in Hazy Days. Players are drawn into a world where gratification is replaced by the necessity to endure and adapt. The game highlights how survival in polluted environments demands sacrificing comfort, making the player confront harsh realities rather than escape them (Freud 1920). This juxtaposition deepens the emotional engagement and reinforces the game’s sobering message.</p>
